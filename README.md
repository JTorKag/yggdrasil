### **Core Commands**
#### **Game Management**
- `/new-game`: Create a new game with detailed settings.
- `/edit-game`: Edit an existing game's properties.
- `/start-game`: Start a game after all pretenders are submitted.
- `/end-game`: Mark a game as finished but keep the lobby active.
- `/delete-lobby`: Delete a gameâ€™s lobby and associated role.
- `/end-game-and-lobby`: End the game and delete the lobby.

#### **Timer Management**
- `/pause-timer`: Pause a running game timer.
- `/extend-timer`: Extend or reduce the remaining time.
- `/set-timer-default`: Change the default timer value.

#### **Game Status**
- `/undone`: View the current turn status, including which nations have played or are still pending.

---

### **API Endpoints**
#### `/preexec_backup`
Triggered before the turn progresses. This backs up game files to a secure location.

#### `/postexec_notify`
Triggered after the turn progresses. Notifies the Discord channel with:
- The current turn number
- Remaining time until the next turn
- Players who missed submitting their turns

---

### **Database Management**
The application uses **SQLite** for storing game and timer data. Key tables include:
- **`games`**: Stores game metadata such as map, era, and active status.
- **`players`**: Tracks player claims and their nations.
- **`gameTimers`**: Manages turn timers and defaults.

---

### **Troubleshooting**
1. **Timer Not Updating**
   - Ensure the TimerManager is initialized and running during startup.
   - Check the `gameTimers` table to ensure `timer_running` is set to `true`.

2. **API Errors**
   - Verify the `dom_data_folder` and `backup_data_folder` paths in the configuration file.
   - Ensure the API server is running on `127.0.0.1:8000`.

3. **Missing Permissions**
   - Ensure the bot has the following Discord permissions:
     - Manage Roles
     - Manage Channels
     - Send Messages
     - Read Message History
     - Manage Messages
